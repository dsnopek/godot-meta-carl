Phase I: Get something working
---

- Demo: Fill in the rest of the UI
  - Improve pointer
    - Use a different signal for pinch? (We can use hand tracking aim if nothing on hand interaction works well enough)
    - Use a different signal for the file dialog? Seems to happen to early?
    - Have aim mesh start a little further away from hand
    - Make aim mesh white and blue (for pressed and not pressed)
    - Hide pointer when not hitting UI layer
    - Hide hands and pointer when we lose OpenXR focus
  - Making new definitions
    - Automatically configure the enabled poses based on the action type
  - Cropping examples
    - Add auto-trimming?
    - Player should allow playing whole thing or limiting to the crop
    - Player should allow enabling or disabling looping
    - Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
  - Select example to play
  - Add counter example
  - Deleting examples
- Fix CI
- At this point, let's merge `carl-slush` into `main`

Phase II: Proper tooling for development
---

- Demo: Implement "nice" UI for constructing and testing examples
  - This should be the real deal!
  - We want a simple "studio" for creating, testing and editing definitions
