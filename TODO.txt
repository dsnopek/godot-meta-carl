TODO
====

- Studio: Allow editing the `default_sensitivity`
- Studio: Use asynchronous resource loading for loading definitions to prevent big hitch
- Studio: Switch to single threaded in the "Test" screen for increased accuracy?
- Studio: Fix playback of wrist trajectories
- Studio: Allow fractional recording times
- Studio: Allow disabling auto-play of examples
  - Instead should just show the first frame
- Studio: Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
- Studio: Add auto-trimming of examples
- Make `ResourceFormatLoader` and `ResourceFormatSaver` for binary formats
  - Have `.carl_definition`, `carl_recording` and maybe `.carl_example` files
  - Store the data compressed with ZSTD? (This seemed to be the best size vs time trade-off)
- Studio: Fix issue with "margin" on the "Examples" tree control
