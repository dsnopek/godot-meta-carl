Post-jam helper methods
-----------------------

- Modify CARL studio to use all the new helper methods (and test them!)
- Add a checkbox (checked by default) that will unwind hands around the HMD Y-axis rotation during detection
  - Or do we want to do this during recording? I get the feeling that we don't, and should keep the recordings "pure"
- Modify the XR jam game to use all the helper methods (and test them!)

Backlog
-------

- Use asynchronous resource loading for loading definitions to prevent big hitch
- Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
- Add auto-trimming of examples
- Make `ResourceFormatLoader` and `ResourceFormatSaver` for binary formats
  - Have `.carl_definition`, `carl_recording` and maybe `.carl_example` files
  - Store the data compressed with ZSTD? (This seemed to be the best size vs time trade-off)
- Fix issue with "margin" on the "Examples" tree control
