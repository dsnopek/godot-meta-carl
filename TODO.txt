Phase I: Get something working
---

- Demo: Fill in the rest of the UI
  - Cropping examples
    - Add auto-trimming?
    - Player should allow playing whole thing or limiting to the crop
    - Player should allow enabling or disabling looping
    - Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
  - RecordScreen should give a countdown (or count up?)
  - Fix ScreenContainer in the editor
    - Changing visibility on screens doesn't trigger hiding of others any more
    - Changing "Current Screen" field doesn't work any more
- Compress recording data?
- Show input sample count as a read-only variable?
- Fix CI
- At this point, let's merge `carl-slush` into `main`

Phase II: Proper tooling for development
---

- Demo: Implement "nice" UI for constructing and testing examples
  - This should be the real deal!
  - We want a simple "studio" for creating, testing and editing definitions
