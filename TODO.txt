Post-jam helper methods
-----------------------

- Add "debug mode" that will show cones for each of the joints, so we can verify that the data is correct
- Port `apply_to_hand_tracker()` that estimates all the joints
  - Get the orientation correct on the ring finger metacarpal
- Add `CARLSession::capture/_from()` etc to capture, and include the "hack" to reuse old data if we lose tracking
- Allow `CARLSession` to take a callback to process all samples in a recognizer as well as new input
- Add a checkbox (checked by default) that will unwind hands around the HMD Y-axis rotation during detection
  - Or do we want to do this during recording? I get the feeling that we don't, and should keep the recordings "pure"

Backlog
-------

- Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
- Add auto-trimming of examples
- Make `ResourceFormatLoader` and `ResourceFormatSaver` for binary formats
  - Have `.carl_definition`, `carl_recording` and maybe `.carl_example` files
  - Store the data compressed with ZSTD? (This seemed to be the best size vs time trade-off)
- Fix issue with "margin" on the "Examples" tree control
