Phase I: Get something working
---

- Fix CI
- At this point, let's merge `carl-slush` into `main`

Backlog:
---

- Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
- Add auto-trimming of examples
- Make `ResourceFormatLoader` and `ResourceFormatSaver` for binary formats
    - Have `.carl_definition`, `carl_recording` and maybe `.carl_example` files
    - Store the data compressed with ZSTD? (This seemed to be the best size vs time trade-off)
- Fix issue with "margin" on the "Examples" tree control
