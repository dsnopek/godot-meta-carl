Phase I: Get something working
---

- Compress recording data?
- Fix issue with "margin" on the "Examples" tree control
- Show input sample count as a read-only variable?
- Fix CI
- At this point, let's merge `carl-slush` into `main`

Phase II: Proper tooling for development
---

- Demo: Implement "nice" UI for constructing and testing examples
  - This should be the real deal!
  - We want a simple "studio" for creating, testing and editing definitions

Backlog:
---

  - Player should allow incrementing or decrementing by a single sample
  - Add auto-trimming of examples
