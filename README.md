# Godot binding for Meta's CARL

[CARL](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/CARL) is an Open Source library from Meta for doing gesture recognition in VR.

This is a GDExtension that allows you to use it in Godot!

It comes with a Godot app for recording and saving gestures (which you can then load into your own Godot game) called "Godot Meta Studio".

You can download binaries for Windows, Linux, MacOS or Android, and APKs of "Godot Meta Studio" for the Meta Quest from the [releases page](https://github.com/dsnopek/godot-meta-carl/releases).
